# Deploy People Counter App using Intel OpenVINO

## What it Does

The people counter application will demonstrate how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count.

## How it Works

The counter will use the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit. The model used should be able to identify people in a video frame. The app should count the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame) and the total count of people. It then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho MQTT Python package.
